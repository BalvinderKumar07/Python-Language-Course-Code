## 📘 What is Python?

**Python** is a powerful, high-level, interpreted programming language known for its **simplicity**, **readability**, and **versatility**. It is widely used for **web development, data science, automation, machine learning, AI, scripting, game development**, and more.

---

## 🧑‍🔬 Who Invented Python?

**Python was created by Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**. His goal was to create a language that emphasized **code readability and clean syntax**, allowing developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than other languages like C or Java.

## ⚙️ How Python Works

Python is an **interpreted language**, which means the code is executed line-by-line at runtime by the Python interpreter. This allows for:

- Rapid development
- Easy debugging
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, Mac)

The Python interpreter reads `.py` files, compiles them to bytecode, and executes them using a virtual machine.
