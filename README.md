Welcome to the official code repository for my Python Programming Course on Coding Solution Point. This repo contains complete Python code examples, practice problems, and solutions based on the video tutorials. Whether you're a beginner or just brushing up your skills, this is the best place to learn Python step-by-step with real code**.

📘 What is Python?
Python is a powerful, high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is widely used for web development, data science, automation, machine learning, AI, scripting, game development, and more.

Who Invented Python?
Guido van Rossum created Python and first released in 1991 His goal was to create a language that emphasized code readability and clean syntax, allowing developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than other languages like C or Java.

How Python Works
Python is an interpreted language, which means the code is executed line-by-line at runtime by the Python interpreter. This allows for:
1. Rapid development
2. Easy debugging
3. Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, Mac)
The Python interpreter reads `.py` files, compiles them to bytecode, and executes them using a virtual machine.

Why Choose Python?
Python is one of the most popular and in-demand languages today. Here's why:
-> Easy to learn – Ideal for beginners
-> Huge community support – Tons of libraries, frameworks, and tutorials
-> Versatile – Web, Data, AI, Automation, and more
-> Readable syntax – Write less, do more

Keyword boost: Python for beginners, learn Python programming, Python tutorial for YouTube, Python examples GitHub, best Python course

Applications of Python
Python is used in nearly every tech domain:
-> Web Development – Django, Flask
-> Machine Learning & AI – TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
-> Data Science – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
-> Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking
-> Automation & Scripting
-> Game Development – Pygame
-> App Prototyping
